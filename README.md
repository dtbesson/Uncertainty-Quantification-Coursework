# Uncertainty-Quantification-Coursework

This was a coursework I completed for my university module "Introduction to Uncertainty Quantification". It involves using MATLAB to implement forward Euler, Monte-Carlo and Euler-Maruyama approximations for stochastic processes, plotting their graphs and observing their qualities.

Please check the attached brief for what exactly we were asked to do.
